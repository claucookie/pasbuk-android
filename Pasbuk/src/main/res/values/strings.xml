  <string name="about_content">"Pasbuk" came up with idea of managing and displaying passbook passes in a Androidish 
way. Some other apps try to imitate the passbook appearance found 
on iOS app and they don\'t take in mind what the user is familiar to.
As a Android user, in my case, I wanted to see the pass info following Apple\'s passbook
format but in a Androidish way :). Since material was born and applied 
to android guidelines, there were no excuses to not make a beautiful
passbook app!</string>
