This a project rescued from 2014 (please dont judge it is just old XD).

This poor guy was left behind due to lack of free time and motivation to maintain it.
However, I've decided to commit to it again and use it to apply refactoring
techniques, get it back to shape again, and use it to follow current Android
standards and best practices.

The code base is very basic and full of code smells and bad practices.
My main purpose is to make it public and keep refactoring it, migrate it
to kotlin and find a suitable architecture I can apply (nonexistent at the moment).

This was my playground for many things in the past: it saw the origins
of material design, the origins of sketch which I use to design the
prototype and icons.

The long term goal is to allow people to contribute to it if they want to,
but not just yet.
